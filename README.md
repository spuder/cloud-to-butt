# Coronavirus to Cooties

Getting tired of the oversaturation, paranoina and fearmongering of the CoronaVirus media?

Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of the following words:



|  |  |
|-------------|---------|
| Coronavirus | Cooties |
| Covid-19 | SwineFlu-2.0 |
| Social Distancing | Tag, Not-It |
| Quarantine | Hide and Seek |
| The CDC | Your Mom |


And more...

This is a fork of the legendary 'cloud-to-butt' chrome extension
